5 Sentence Summary

Introduction: The annual student government elections at our university have traditionally been conducted using Google Forms.

Related Work: Existing election systems like Election Buddy offer similar functionalities but are not suitable for our university’s budget, Google Forms is another commonly used tool.

Problem Statement: The use of Google Forms for student elections resulted in vulnerabilities such as potential breaches of voter anonymity, difficulty in preventing multiple submissions, and challenges in efficiently managing and verify++ing results.

Solution Proposal: We propose developing a dedicated election software system that integrates with the university’s ID system, ensuring secure, anonymous voting, preventing double voting, and providing real-time, transparent results.

Validation: The success of this system will be measured by its ability to eliminate the issues previously encountered with Google Forms, particularly in terms of security, anonymity, and result management, leading to its adoption for future elections at the university.
